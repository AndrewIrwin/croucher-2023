    "text": "About the author and course instructor\nThese course notes were written by Andrew Irwin (Department of Mathematics & Statistics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada). Andrew’s research applies mathematical and statistical models to problems in biological oceanography, particularly questions about phytoplankton biogeography, productivity, and their role in biogeochemical cycles. The prospect of large-scale systemic change over the next century plays a key motivating role in the desire to understand this important system more fully. Andrew co-directs the Marine Microbial Macroecology Lab at Dalhousie and more information about his research can be found there."

A primary goal of the project was to better understand carbon export in this part of the ocean which is notable for its well preserved and laminated sediments. Here we will use the samples of phytoplankton and zooplankton from the upper mixed layer.\nData are arcived on BCO-DMO. A subset of the data we will use is in the github project."
