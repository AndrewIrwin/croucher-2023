## About the author and course instructor

These course notes were written by Andrew Irwin (Department of Mathematics & Statistics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada).  Andrewâ€™s research applies mathematical and statistical models to problems in biological oceanography, particularly questions about phytoplankton biogeography, productivity, and their role in biogeochemical cycles. The prospect of large-scale systemic change over the next century plays a key motivating role in the desire to understand this important system more fully. Andrew co-directs the [Marine Microbial Macroecology Lab](https://www.mmmlab.ca) at Dalhousie and more information about his research can be found there.
